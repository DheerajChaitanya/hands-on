**Authentication**  

Principal claiming who you are.

## Shared responsibility and security model

Security of the cloud is AWS cloud  
Security in the cloud is your responsibility

## Service Models

IAAS  
PAAS  
SAAS  - low maintenace, fairly inflexible

## High Availability vs fault tolerance

- fault tolerance (engine not working on plane)
- high availability

## Disaster Recovery

**RPO - Recovery point objective**
_A Recovery Point Objective is the amount of data loss, measured in time, that is tolerable in a disaster. For some systems, losing a day’s worth of data might be acceptable while for other systems this might be mere minutes or seconds. The length of RTO’s and RPO’s have profound implications on how disaster recovery plans are implemented._

**RTO - Recovery time objective**
_A Recovery Time Objective is the maximum amount of time that a system can be down before it is recovered to an operational state. For some systems, this recovery time objective can be measured in hours or even days, but for more mission-critical systems the recovery time objectives are typically measured in seconds._
