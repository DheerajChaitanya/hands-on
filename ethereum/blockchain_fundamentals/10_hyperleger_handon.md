World State

Ethereum
 Staging Area: It holds the validated transaction. These transctions are not confirmed yet.
 Ledger: Where you have the transctions that are commited in Block and are agreed upon by the network. These are confirmed

Hyperledger: (Send a proposal, get approval from the participants in the business network, attach that approval along with the pproposal and summit it for confirmations)
World State (Ledger - validated and confirmed transactions)
Ledger State (Transcations that were ever submitted valid or )

Steps for Demo:

npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-hyperledger-composer-network


Creating from front end -- admin@network-name

-- Network Card ---> Connection String 
user name
password
hypeledger i am connecting to
MSP --> Creating a network card --->


WebSite -->

Web Server
Deploy your application - Administrator
Crete profile for user -- users can access the application

Hypeleger Node Running [Platform is running]
Install on top of running hyperledger platform is BNA
BNA is a template for how the Business network will be struc
Admin network card. Participants :)
Map the identity to the particpant  ] network card for the participant


Hypeleger Node  --> BNA 
Hypeleger Node  --> BNA (Business Network Archive)

Zipping up or Archiving the file (model, logic, acl, query)

Transactions ---> Deploy, Invoke

Invoke (Chain Code, Function, {input1, input2})
Specialized Invoke (deploy, {smart contract})

Invoke is a general function

Call Method - Read the data from the chain 
Send Method - We write the data to the chain


Cost of using hyperledger is ---> hardware, space, electricity, ban


Hypeledger -->  Inbuilt API <before version  1.0>
Hyperledger ---> node SDK, Java SDK, Go SDk --> API ---> Front end


Submitting a proposal ---> Peers (Endorsing Peers)

Local Copy of DB (Ledger) current state ---> simulate the transction you have submitted.

Ravikant is going to transfer 10 USD
current state (Ravikant 20USD)  ----> valid transation it will not endores it  --> NextState 10USD  ---> Valid one and i am ok with this
current state (Ravikant 20USD)
current state (Ravikant 20USD)

Ravikant is going to send this proposal with endorsement to be s committed

---> Update of world state

current state is updated from (20->10)

User Experience

Create a wallet
Create a public and private key
Fund this up
Then connect to a network (mainnet)
They you can do a transaction

Gmail, linkeid, facebook

ethereum ---> addresses ----> wallet 
hyperleger ---> participant (defined by BN) ---> certificates  --> email address
